Followed your direction aunched the QA Copilot. Have an option select the Board, since we use mocked data we should have some demo Board, right?

Yes, exactly! The mock data includes demo boards, but it seems there might be an issue with the select dropdown. Let me check and fix the frontend to properly display the mock boards:

The Dashboard looks correct. Let me check if the API is returning the boards properly. Let me also add some better error handling and logging:


F

Write file


Now let me also ensure the CSS is properly imported:

Now, let's make sure the mock service is returning boards in the correct format. Let me check the controller:

The controller looks good. Now let me make sure the mock service is properly initialized when JIRA auth fails. Let me update the backend server to add a test endpoint:

Now restart your servers and check if the mock data is working. You can test it directly by visiting:

Check health endpoint: http://localhost:3001/health
Test mock data directly: http://localhost:3001/api/test-mock
Test boards API: http://localhost:3001/api/jira/boards
If the boards are still not showing up in the dropdown, open the browser console (F12) and check for any errors. The updated Dashboard component now includes debug information that will show in the console.

The mock data includes:

3 Demo Boards:
QA Team Board (scrum)
Development Board (kanban)
Product Backlog (scrum)
1 Active Sprint: "Sprint 23 - Q4 Release Prep"
5 Demo Issues with various types and statuses
Try refreshing the page, and you should see:

The boards in the dropdown
When you select "QA Team Board", it should show the active sprint
The sprint should display 5 demo issues
Let me know what you see in the browser console or if you get any specific error messages!

Error loading boards
Network Error
Check the console for more details

The Network Error indicates the frontend can't connect to the backend. Let's troubleshoot this:

🔍 Quick Troubleshooting Steps
1. Check if the backend is running
Open a new terminal and check:

bash
curl http://localhost:3001/health
If this doesn't work, the backend isn't running.

2. Make sure both servers are running
You need TWO terminal windows:

Terminal 1 - Backend:

bash
cd "/Users/alpinro/Code Prjects/qa-copilot/qa-copilot/backend"
npm run dev
Terminal 2 - Frontend:

bash
cd "/Users/alpinro/Code Prjects/qa-copilot/qa-copilot/frontend"
npm run dev
3. Or use the combined command (if you have concurrently installed):
bash
cd "/Users/alpinro/Code Prjects/qa-copilot/qa-copilot"
npm run dev
Let me check if you have the frontend environment file set up correctly:


F

Good, the frontend .env is correct. Let me check if the API service is properly configured:

The API configuration looks correct. Let me create a simple test page to debug the connection:

Now, follow these steps:

🔧 Fix the Connection Issue
Step 1: Ensure both servers are running
You need TWO separate terminals:

Terminal 1 - Backend:

bash
cd "/Users/alpinro/Code Prjects/qa-copilot/qa-copilot/backend"
npm run dev
You should see:

✨ QA Copilot API running on http://localhost:3001
📊 Health check: http://localhost:3001/health
🎭 Test mock data: http://localhost:3001/api/test-mock
🎭 === RUNNING IN MOCK MODE ===
Terminal 2 - Frontend:

bash
cd "/Users/alpinro/Code Prjects/qa-copilot/qa-copilot/frontend"  
npm run dev
You should see:

VITE ready in X ms
➜ Local: http://localhost:5173/
Step 2: Test the connection
Go to: http://localhost:5173/test-connection
Click "Run Connection Tests"
See which tests pass/fail
Step 3: Common fixes
If the backend isn't starting:

bash
# Check if port 3001 is already in use
lsof -i :3001

# Kill any process using it
kill -9 [PID]

# Or use a different port
PORT=3002 npm run dev
If you see CORS errors:

bash
# Make sure you're accessing frontend via localhost:5173
# NOT via 127.0.0.1 or any other address
Step 4: Quick Alternative - Run Everything in One Terminal
If you haven't installed dependencies in the root:

bash
cd "/Users/alpinro/Code Prjects/qa-copilot/qa-copilot"
npm install

# This will run both frontend and backend
npm run dev
What you should see when it's working:
Backend terminal shows requests coming in:
2024-XX-XX XX:XX:XX info: GET /api/jira/boards
Frontend at http://localhost:5173 shows:
3 boards in the dropdown
When you select a board, you see the sprint
5 demo issues appear
