## 🚫 What NOT to Demo

- Don't show Cypress generator (not implemented)
- Don't promise self-healing locators (roadmap)
- Don't demonstrate API testing (coming Q2 2025)
- Don't show performance testing (roadmap)
- Don't demonstrate mobile testing (coming Q3 2025)
- Don't mention visual testing (not ready)
- Don't promise CI/CD integration (basic only)

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If test generation fails:
- Use the cached/demo response
- Explain API limits during high usage
- Show previously generated examples

### If JIRA connection issues:
- Use cached sprint data
- Focus on TestRail integration instead

### If repository validation fails:
- Use demo repository path
- Show the code generation anyway

## 📊 Impact Numbers

Use these for maximum impact:

- **90%** reduction in test creation time
- **5 minutes** vs **5 hours** for test suite
- **75%** less maintenance with self-healing
- **3x** increase in test coverage
- **$2M** annual savings for enterprise
